# **Graph Visualiser v2**

Extension of the graph visualiser me and @wangy412 did a long time ago, this time for CEP.

## **TODO**

-   [x] Create initial setup for project (3/5)
-   [x] Setup Dynamic Parameters for routes (3/5)
-   [x] Represent data in app (5/5)
-   [x] Build UI to adjust parameters (7/5)
    -   [x] Bi-directional/Uni-directional
    -   [x] Show Graph Weights (don't show, show using line, show using thickness)
-   [ ] Build import/export data in UI
-   [x] Display Graph
-   [ ] Account for other settings, such as bidirectional and weight of nodes + edges
-   [ ] Add Physics to Graph, and interactivity
-   [ ] Hook route parameters for sharing of graphs
        DONE!

## **DEVLOGS**

-   4th May: Completed the main control panel UI. Of course, there is still the edge colour and the line colour settings to be added. I have also reorganised most of the code to hopefully fit better with the layout and things. :D

-   7th May: Refuribished control panel, allowing it to be collapsed.

-   9th May: Implemented all of the UI settings, worked out integrating p5 into the website, so that it can be used to easily display the graph. I have done a rough display of the graph itself, but more improvements are to come!
